# 1. Transferring large amount of data into AWS

- **Example:** transfer 200 TB of data in the cloud. We have a 100 Mbps internet connection.
- **Over the internet / Site-to-Site VPN**
  - Immediate to setup.
  - Will take 200(TB)*1000(GB)*1000(MB)\*8(Mb)/100 Mbps = 16,000,000s = 185d.
- **Over direct connect 1Gbps**
  - Long for the one-time setup (over a month).
  - Will take 200(TB)\*1000(GB)\*8(Gb)/1 Gbps = 1,600,000s = 18.5d.
- **Over Snowball**
  - Will take 2 to 3 snowballs in parallel.
  - Takes about 1 week for the end-to-end transfer.
  - Can be combined with DMS.
- For on-going replication / transfers: Site-to-Site VPN or DX with DMS or DataSync.
