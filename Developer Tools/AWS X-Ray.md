# 1. Introduction

- Debugging in Production, the good old way:
  - Test locally.
  - Add log statements everywhere.
  - Re-deploy in production.
- Log formats differ across applications using CloudWatch and analytics is hard.
- Debugging: monolith "easy", distributed services "hard".
- No common views of your entire architecture!
- Tracing requests across your microservices (distributed systems).

# 2. Visual analysis of our applications

# 3. Advantages

- Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks).
- Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture.
- Pinpoint service issues.
- Review request behavior.
- Find errors and exceptions.
- Are we meeting time SLA?
- Where I am throttled?
- Identify users that are impacted.

# 4. Compatibility

- Integrations with:
  - EC2 - install the X-Ray agent.
  - ECS - install the X-Ray agent or Docker container.
  - Lambda.
  - Beanstalk - agent is automatically installed.
  - API Gateway - helpful to debug errors (such as 504).
  - ELB.
- The X-Ray agent or services need IAM permissions to X-Ray.

# 5. Leverages Tracing

- Tracing is an end to end way to following a "request".
- Each component dealing with the request adds its own "trace".
- Tracing is made of segments (+ sub segments).
- Annotations can be added to traces to provide extra-information
- Ability to trace:
  - Every request.
  - Sample request (as a % for example or a rate per minute).
- X-Ray Security:
  - IAM for authorization.
  - KMS for encryption at rest.

# 6. How to enable it?

1. Your code (Java, Python, Go, Node.js, .NET) must import the AWS X-Ray SDK:

- Very little code modification needed.
- The application SDK will then capture:
  - Calls to AWS services.
  - HTTP / HTTPS requests.
  - Database Calls (MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB).
  - Queue calls (SQS).

2. Install the X-Ray daemon or enable X-Ray AWS Integration:

- X-Ray daemon works as a low level UDP packet interceptor (Linux / Windows / Mac...).
- AWS Lambda / other AWS services already run the X-Ray daemon for you.
- Each application must have the IAM rights to write data to X-Ray.

# 7. X-Ray magic

- X-Ray service collects data from all the different services.
- Service map is computed from all the segments and traces.
- X-Ray is graphical, so even non technical people can help troubleshoot.

# 8. Troubleshooting

- If X-Ray is not working on EC2:
  - Ensure the EC2 IAM Role has the proper permissions.
  - Ensure the EC2 instance is running the X-Ray Daemon.
- To enable on AWS Lambda:
  - Ensure it has an IAM execution role with proper policy (AWSX-RayWriteOnlyAccess).
  - Ensure that X-Ray is imported in the code.

# 9. Instrumentation in your code

- **Instrumentation** means the measure of product's performance, diagnose errors, and to write trace information.
- To instrument your application code, you use the **X-Ray SDK**.
- Many SDK require only configuration changes.
- You can modify your application code to customize and annotation the data that the SDK sends to X- Ray, using **interceptors, filters, handlers, middleware...**

# 10. X-Ray Concepts

- **Segments:** Each application / service will send them.
- **Subsegments:** If you need more details in your segment.
  - `namespace` - aws for AWS SDK calls; remote for other downstream calls.
- **Trace:** Segments collected together to form an end-to-end trace.
- **Sampling:** Decrease the amount of requests sent to X-Ray, reduce cost.
- **Annotations:** Key Value pairs used to **index** traces and use with **filters**.
- **Metadata:** Key Value pairs, **not indexed**, not used for searching.
- The X-Ray daemon / agent has a config to send traces cross account:
  - Make sure the IAM permissions are correct - the agent will assume the role.
  - This allows to have a central account for all your application tracing.

# 11. Sampling Rules

- With sampling rules, you control the amount of data that you record.
- You can modify sampling rules without changing your code.
- By default, the **X-Ray SDK** records the **first request** each second, and _five percent_ of any additional requests.
  - **One request per second is the reservoir**, which ensures that at least one trace is recorded each second as long the service is serving requests.
  - _Five percent is the rate_ at which additional requests beyond the reservoir size are sampled.

# 12. Custom Sampling Rules

- You can create your own rules with the **reservoir** and _rate_.

# 13. X-Ray Write and Read APIs

## 13.1. Write APIs (used by the X-Ray daemon)

- `PutTraceSegments` - Uploads segment documents to AWS X-Ray.
- `PutTelemetryRecords` - Used by the AWS X-Ray daemon to upload telemetry
  - SegmentsReceivedCount
  - SegmentsRejectedCounts
  - BackendConnectionErrors...
- `GetSamplingRules` - Retrieve all sampling rules (to know what/when to send).
- `GetSamplingTargets` and `GetSamplingStatisticSummaries` - Advanced.
- The X-Ray daemon needs to have an IAM policy authorizing the correct API calls to function correctly.

### 13.1.1. Segment documents

![Segment documents](/Images/AwsXRaySegmentDocuments.png)

## 13.2. Read APIs

- `GetServiceGraph` - Main graph.
- `BatchGetTraces` - Retrieves a list of traces specified by ID.
  - Each trace is a collection of segment documents that originates from a single request.
- `GetTraceSummaries` - Retrieves IDs and annotations for traces available for a specified time frame using an optional filter.
  - To get the full traces, pass the trace IDs to `BatchGetTraces`.
- `GetTraceGraph` - Retrieves a service graph for one or more specific trace IDs.

# 14. X-Ray with Elastic Beanstalk

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk platforms include the X-Ray daemon.
- You can run the daemon by setting an option in the Elastic Beanstalk console or with a configuration file (in .ebextensions/xray-daemon.config).
  ```yaml
  option_settings:
    aws:elasticbeanstalk:xray:
      XRayEnabled: true
  ```
- Make sure to give your instance profile the correct IAM permissions so that the X-Ray daemon can function correctly.
- Then make sure your application code is instrumented with the X-Ray SDK.
- Note: The X-Ray daemon is not provided for Multicontainer Docker.

# 15. AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry

- Secure, production-ready AWS-supported distribution of the open-source project OpenTelemetry project.
- Provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services.
- Collects distributed traces and metrics from your apps.
- Collects metadata from your AWS resources and services.
- **Auto-instrumentation Agents** to collect traces without changing your code.
- Send traces and metrics to multiple AWS services and partner solutions.
- X-Ray, CloudWatch, Prometheus...
- Instrument your apps running on AWS (e.g., [ECS](AWS%20EC2.md), [ECS](AWS%20ECS.md), EKS, Fargate, [Lambda](AWS%20Lambda.md)) as well as on-premises.
- **Migrate from X-Ray to AWS Distro for Temeletry if you want to standardize with open-source APIs from Telemetry or send traces to multiple destinations simultaneously.**

# 16. Running the X-Ray daemon on Amazon ECS

- In [Amazon ECS](AWS%20ECS.md):
  1. Create a Docker image that runs the X-Ray daemon.
  2. Upload it to a Docker image repository.
  3. Deploy it to your [Amazon ECS](AWS%20ECS.md) cluster.
- You can use port mappings and network mode settings in your task definition file to allow your application to communicate with the daemon container.
