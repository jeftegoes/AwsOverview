# 1. Introduction

- Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript.
  - Python.
  - Java.
  - .NET.
- Contains high level components called `constructs`.
- The code is "compiled" into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML).
- **You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together.**
  - Great for Lambda functions.
  - Great for Docker containers in ECS / EKS.

# 3. CDK vs SAM

- **SAM**
  - Serverless focused.
  - Write your template declaratively in JSON or YAML.
  - Great for quickly getting started with Lambda.
  - Leverages CloudFormation.
- **CDK**
  - All AWS services.
  - Write infra in a programming language:
    - JavaScript/TypeScript.
    - Python.
    - Java.
    - .NET.
  - Leverages CloudFormation.
- You can use SAM CLI to locally test your CDK apps.
- **You must first run cdk synth.**

# 4. Constructs

- CDK Construct is a component that encapsulates everything CDK needs to create the final CloudFormation stack.
- Can represent a single AWS resource (e.g., S3 bucket) or multiple related resources (e.g., worker queue with compute).
- **AWS Construct Library**
  - A collection of Constructs included in AWS CDK which contains Constructs for every AWS resource.
  - Contains 3 different levels of Constructs available (L1, L2, L3).
- **Construct Hub:** Contains additional Constructs from AWS, 3rd parties, and open-source CDK community.

## 4.1. Layer 1 Constructs (L1)

- Can be called **CFN Resources** which represents all resources directly available in CloudFormation.
- Constructs are periodically generated from **CloudFormation Resource Specification**.
- Construct names start with **Cfn** (e.g., **CfnBucket**).
- **You must explicitly configure all resource properties.**

## 4.2. Layer 2 Constructs (L2)

- Represents AWS resources but with a higher level (intent-based API).
- Similar functionality as L1 but with convenient defaults and boilerplate.
  - You don't need to know all the details about the resource properties.
- Provide methods that make it simpler to work with the resource (e.g., **bucket.addLifeCycleRule()**).

## 4.3. Layer 3 Constructs (L3)

- Can be called **Patterns**, which represents multiple related resources.
- Helps you complete common tasks in AWS.
- **Examples**
  - **aws-apigateway.LambdaRestApi** represents an API Gateway backed by a Lambda function.
  - **aws-ecs-patterns.ApplicationLoadBalancerFargateService** which represents an architecture that includes a Fargate cluster with Application Load Balancer.

# 5. CDK - Important Commands to know

| Command                    | Description                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| npm install -g aws-cdk-lib | Install the CDK CLI and libraries                  |
| cdk init app               | Create a new CDK project from a specified template |
| cdk synth                  | Synthesizes and prints the CloudFormation template |
| cdk bootstrap              | Deploys the CDK Toolkit staging Stack              |
| cdk deploy                 | Deploy the Stack(s)                                |
| cdk diff                   | View differences of local CDK and deployed Stack   |
| cdk destroy                | Destroy the Stack(s)                               |

# 6. Bootstrapping

- The process of provisioning resources for CDK before you can deploy CDK apps into an AWS Environment.
  - **AWS Environment = account & region.**
- CloudFormation Stack called **CDKToolkit** is created and contains:
  - **S3 Bucket:** To store files
  - **IAM Roles:** To grant permissions to perform deployments
- You must run the following command for each new environment:
  - `cdk bootstrap aws://<aws_account>/<aws_region>`
- Otherwise, you will get an **error "Policy contains a statement with one or more invalid principal"**.

# 7. Testing

- To test CDK apps, use **CDK Assertions Module** combined with popular test frameworks such as Jest (JavaScript) or Pytest (Python).
- Verify we have specific resources, rules, conditions, parameters...
- **Two types of tests**
  - **Fine-grained Assertions (common):** Test specific aspects of the CloudFormation template (e.g., check if a resource has this property with this value)
  - **Snapshot Tests:** Test the synthesized CloudFormation template against a previously stored baseline template
- **To import a template**
  - Template.fromStack(MyStack) : stack built in CDK
  - Template.fromString(mystring) : stack build outside CDK

# 8. CDK development workflow

- The standard AWS CDK development workflow is similar to the workflow you're already familiar as a developer. There are a few extra steps:

1. **Create the app from a template provided by AWS CDK** - Each AWS CDK app should be in its own directory, with its own local module dependencies. Create a new directory for your app. Now initialize the app using the cdk init command, specifying the desired template ("app") and programming language. The cdk init command creates a number of files and folders inside the created home directory to help you organize the source code for your AWS CDK app.
2. **Add code to the app to create resources within stacks** - Add custom code as is needed for your application.
3. **Build the app (optional)** - In most programming environments, after making changes to your code, you'd build (compile) it. This isn't strictly necessary with the AWS CDKâ€”the Toolkit does it for you so you can't forget. But you can still build manually whenever you want to catch syntax and type errors.
4. **Synthesize one or more stacks in the app to create an AWS CloudFormation template** - Synthesize one or more stacks in the app to create an AWS CloudFormation template. The synthesis step catches logical errors in defining your AWS resources. If your app contains more than one stack, you'd need to specify which stack(s) to synthesize.
5. **Deploy one or more stacks to your AWS account** - It is optional (though good practice) to synthesize before deploying. The AWS CDK synthesizes your stack before each deployment. If your code has security implications, you'll see a summary of these and need to confirm them before deployment proceeds. cdk deploy is used to deploy the stack using CloudFormation templates. This command displays progress information as your stack is deployed. When it's done, the command prompt reappears.
