- Stop guessing your capacity needs.
- Test systems at production scale.
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier.
- Allow for evolutionary architectures.
  - Design based on changing requirements.
- Drive architectures using data.
- Improve through game days.
  - Simulate applications for flash sale days.

## 1.2. 6 Pillars

1. Operational Excellence.
2. Security.
3. Reliability.
4. Performance Efficiency.
