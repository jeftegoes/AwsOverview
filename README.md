# 1. Traditionally, how to build infrastructure

## 1.1. How websites work

- Clients have IP addresses.
- Servers have IP addresses.

## 1.2. What is a server composed of?

- Compute: CPU.
- Memory: RAM.
- Storage: Data.
- Database: Store data in a structured way.
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS server.

## 1.3. IT Terminology

- Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other.
- Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer
  networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
- Switch: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network.

## 1.4. Problems with traditional IT approach

- Pay for the rent for the data center.
- Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance.
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time.
- Scaling is limited.
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure.
- How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire...).
- Can we externalize all this? **CLOUD**

# 2. What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need.
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly.
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services.
- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

## 2.1. You've been using some Cloud services

- Gmail
  - E-mail cloud service
  - Pay for ONLY your emails stored (no infrastructure, etc.)
- Dropbox
  - Cloud Storage Service
  - Originally built on AWS
- Netflix
  - Built on AWS
  - Video on Demand

## 2.2. The Deployment Models of the Cloud

### 2.2.1. Private Cloud:

- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
- Complete control.
- Security for sensitive applications.
- Meet specific business needs.

### 2.2.2. Public Cloud:

- Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.

### 2.2.3. Hybrid Cloud:

- Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud.
- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure.
- Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud.

## 2.3. The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- On-demand self service:
  - Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
- Broad network access:
  - Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
  - Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
  - Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
- Rapid elasticity and scalability:
  - Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
  - Quickly and easily scale based on demand
- Measured service:
  - Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## 2.4. Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
  - Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware
  - Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
  - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- Stop guessing capacity
  - Scale based on actual measured usage
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

## 2.5. Problems solved by the Cloud

- Flexibility: change resource types when needed
- Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
- Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
- Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

## 2.6. Types of Cloud Computing

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Provide building blocks for cloud IT.
  - Provides networking, computers, data storage space.
  - Highest level of flexibility.
  - Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure.
  - Focus on the deployment and management of your applications.
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.

## 2.7. Example of Cloud Computing Types

- Infrastructure as a Service
  - Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
  - GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
- Platform as a Service:
  - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
  - Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)
- Software as a Service:
  - Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)
  - Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

## 2.8. Pricing of the Cloud - Quick Overview

- AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing
  model
  - Compute:
    - Pay for compute time
  - Storage:
    - Pay for data stored in the Cloud
  - Data transfer **OUT** of the Cloud:
    - Data transfer IN is free
  - Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT

## 2.9. AWS Global Infrastructure

- AWS Regions.
- AWS Availability Zones.
- AWS Data Centers.
- AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence.
- https://infrastructure.aws/

## 2.10. AWS Regions

- AWS has Regions all around the world.
- Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3...
- A region is a cluster of data centers.
- Most AWS services are region-scoped.

## 2.11. How to choose an AWS Region?

- **Compliance** with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.
- **Proximity** to customers: reduced latency.
- **Available services** within a Region: new services and new features aren't available in every Region.
- **Pricing** pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.
- **Capacity is unlimited in the cloud, you do not need to worry about it. The 4 points of considerations when choosing an AWS Region are: compliance with data governance and legal requirements, proximity to customers, available services and features within a Region, and pricing.**

## 2.12. AWS Availability Zones

- Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6).
- Example:
  - ap-southeast-2a
  - ap-southeast-2b
  - ap-southeast-2c
- Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- They're separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters.
- They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.

## 2.13. AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

- Amazon has 216 Points of Presence (205 Edge Locations & 11 Regional Caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries.
- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency.

## 2.14. Tour of the AWS Console

- AWS has Global Services:
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  - Route 53 (DNS service)
  - CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
  - WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Most AWS services are Region-scoped:
  - Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
  - Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
  - Lambda (Function as a Service)
  - Rekognition (Software as a Service)
- Region Table: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services

## 2.15. Shared Responsibility Model diagram

- AWS = RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SECURITY OF THE CLOUD
- CUSTOMER = RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SECURITY IN THE CLOUD
- https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/

## 2.16. AWS Acceptable Use Policy

- https://aws.amazon.com/aup/
- No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content
- No Security Violations
- No Network Abuse
- No E-Mail or Other Message Abuse

# 3. IAM - Identity and Access Management and AWS CLI

[IAM - Identity and Access Management and AWS CLI](/Security,%20Identity,%20&%20Compliance/AWS%20IAM.md)

## 3.1. IAM - Summary

- **Users**: mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console.
- **Groups**: contains users only.
- **Policies**: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups.
- **Roles**: for EC2 instances or AWS services.
- **Security**: MFA + Password Policy.

[Compute](Compute/README.md)

# 5. Storage

[Storage](Storage/README.md)

# 6. Databases

[Databases](Database/README.md)

# 7. Other Compute Services: ECS, Batch, Lightsail

## 7.1. ECS - Elastic Container Service, Fargate and ECR - Elastic Container Registry

[AWS ECS, Fargate and ECR](AWS%20ECS.md)

## 7.2. AWS Batch

- **Fully managed** batch processing at **any scale**.
- Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch jobs on AWS.
- A "batch" job is a job with a start and an end (opposed to continuous).
- Batch will dynamically launch **EC2 instances** or **Spot Instances**.
- AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute / memory.
- You submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS Batch does the rest!
- Batch jobs are defined as **Docker images** and **run on ECS**.
- Helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure.

## 7.3. Batch vs Lambda

- Lambda:
  - Time limit.
  - Limited runtimes.
  - Limited temporary disk space.
  - Serverless.
- Batch:
  - No time limit.
  - Any runtime as long as it's packaged as a Docker image.
  - Rely on EBS / instance store for disk space.
  - Relies on EC2 (can be managed by AWS).

## 7.4. Amazon Lightsail

- **Amazon Lightsail is designed to be the easiest way to launch and manage a virtual private server with AWS. Lightsail plans include everything you need to jumpstart your project - a virtual machine, SSD- based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP address - for a low, predictable price. It can be used to create a simple web application, a website or a dev/test environment.**
- Virtual servers, storage, databases, and networking.
- Low & predictable pricing.
- Simpler alternative to using EC2, RDS, ELB, EBS, Route 53...
- Great for people with little cloud experience!
- Can setup notifications and monitoring of your Lightsail resources.
- Use cases:
  - Simple web applications (has templates for LAMP, Nginx, MEAN, Node.js...).
  - Websites (templates for WordPress, Magento, Plesk, Joomla).
  - Dev / Test environment.
- Has high availability but no auto-scaling, limited AWS integrations.

## 7.5. Other Compute - Summary

- Docker: container technology to run applications.

# 8. Global Infrastructure

## 8.1. Why make a global application?

- A **global application** is an application deployed in **multiple geographies**.
- On AWS: this could be **Regions** and / or **Edge Locations**.
- Decreased Latency:
  - Latency is the time it takes for a network packet to reach a server.
  - It takes time for a packet from Asia to reach the US.
  - Deploy your applications closer to your users to decrease latency, better experience.
- Disaster Recovery (DR):
  - If an AWS region goes down (earthquake, storms, power shutdown, politics)...
  - You can fail-over to another region and have your application still working.
  - A DR plan is important to increase the availability of your application.
- Attack protection: distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack

## 8.2. Global AWS Infrastructure

- **Regions:** For deploying applications and infrastructure
- **Availability Zones:** Made of multiple data centers
- **Edge Locations (Points of Presence):** for content delivery as close as possible to users

## 8.3. Global Applications in AWS

- **Global DNS: Route 53**
  - Great to route users to the closest deployment with least latency
  - Great for disaster recovery strategies
- **Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront**
  - Replicate part of your application to AWS Edge Locations - decrease latency
  - Cache common requests - improved user experience and decreased latency
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration**
  - Accelerate global uploads & downloads into Amazon S3
- **AWS Global Accelerator:**
  - Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network

## 8.4. AWS CloudFront

[AWS CloudFront](AWS%20CloudFront.md)

## 8.5. AWS Global Accelerator

- Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network.
- Leverage the AWS internal network to optimize the route to your application (60% improvement).
- 2 Anycast IP are created for your application and traffic is sent through Edge Locations.
- The Edge locations send the traffic to your application.

## 8.6. AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront

- They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world.
- Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
- CloudFront - Content Delivery Network:
  - Improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos).
  - Content is served at the edge.
- Global Accelerator:
  - No caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
  - Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP.
  - Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses.
  - Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover.

## 8.7. AWS Outposts

- Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure.
- Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems:
  - One for the AWS cloud (using the AWS console, CLI, and AWS APIs).
  - One for their on-premises infrastructure.
- AWS Outposts are "server racks" that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud.
- AWS will setup and manage "Outposts Racks" within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises.
- You are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security.
- Benefits:
  - Low-latency access to on-premises systems
  - Local data processing
  - Data residency
  - Easier migration from on-premises to the cloud
  - Fully managed service

# 9. Cloud Integration

- When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another.
- There are two patterns of application communication:
  1. Synchronous communications (application to application).
  2. Asynchronous / Event based (application to queue to application).
- Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic.
- What if you need to suddenly encode 1000 videos but usually it's 10?
- In that case, it's better to decouple your applications:
  - using SQS: queue model.
  - using SNS: pub/sub model.
  - using Kinesis: real-time data streaming model.
- These services can scale independently from our application!

## 9.1. Amazon SQS - Standard Queue

- **Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. It uses a pull-based system.** [Amazon SQS](/Application%20Integration/Amazon%20SQS.md)

## 9.2. Amazon Kinesis

- **Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information. Kinesis offers four services: Data Firehose, Data Analytics, Data Streams, Video Streams.** [Amazon Kinesis](/Analytics/Amazon%20Kinesis.md)

## 9.3. Amazon SNS

- **Is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. It uses a push-based system.** [Amazon SNS](/Application%20Integration/Amazon%20SNS.md.md)

## 9.4. Amazon MQ

- **Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud.**
- SQS, SNS are "cloud-native" services, and they're using proprietary protocols from AWS.
- Traditional applications running from on-premise may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS.
- When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ.
- Amazon MQ = managed Apache ActiveMQ.
- Amazon MQ doesn't "scale" as much as SQS / SNS.
- Amazon MQ runs on a dedicated machine (not serverless).
- Amazon MQ has both queue feature (SQS) and topic features (SNS).

## 9.5. Integration - Summary

- SQS:
  - Queue service in AWS.
  - Multiple Producers, messages are kept up to 14 days.
  - Multiple Consumers share the read and delete messages when done.
  - Used to decouple applications in AWS.
- SNS:
  - Notification service in AWS.
  - Subscribers: Email, Lambda, SQS, HTTP, Mobile...
  - Multiple Subscribers, send all messages to all of them.
  - No message retention.
- Kinesis: real-time data streaming, persistence and analysis.
- Amazon MQ: managed Apache MQ in the cloud (MQTT, AMQP protocols).
- **When using SQS or SNS, you apply the "decouple your applications" principle. This means that IT systems should be designed in a way that reduces interdependencies-a change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components.**
