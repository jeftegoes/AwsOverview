# 1. Introduction

- Alternative to Amazon Kinesis.
- Fully managed Apache Kafka on AWS.
  - Allow you to create, update, delete clusters.
  - MSK creates & manages Kafka brokers nodes & Zookeeper nodes for you.
  - Deploy the MSK cluster in your VPC, multi-AZ (up to 3 for HA).
  - Automatic recovery from common Apache Kafka failures.
  - Data is stored on EBS volumes **for as long as you want**.
- **MSK Serverless**
  - Run Apache Kafka on MSK without managing the capacity.
  - MSK automatically provisions resources and scales compute & storage.
