# 1. Why encryption?

## 1.1. Encryption in flight (SSL)

- Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving.
- SSL certificates help with encryption (HTTPS).
- Encryption in flight ensures no MITM (man in the middle attack) can happen.

## 1.2. Server side encryption at rest

- Data is encrypted after being received by the server.
- Data is decrypted before being sent.
- It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a data key).
- The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere and the server must have access to it.

## 1.3. Client side encryption

- Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server.
- Data will be decrypted by a receiving client.
- The server should not be able to decrypt the data.
- Could leverage Envelope Encryption.

# 2. AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

- Anytime you hear "encryption" for an AWS service, it's most likely KMS.
- AWS manages encryption keys for us.
- Fully integrated with IAM for authorization.
- Easy way to control access to your data.
- Able to audit KMS Key usage using CloudTrail.
- Seamlessly integrated into most AWS services (EBS, S3, RDS, SSM...).
- **Never ever store your secrets in plaintext, especially in your code!**
  - KMS Key Encryption also available through API calls (SDK, CLI).
  - Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables.

## 2.1. KMS Keys Types

- **KMS Keys is the new name of KMS Customer Master Key (CMK).**
  - AWS KMS is replacing the term customer master key (CMK) with AWS KMS key and KMS key. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, AWS KMS is keeping some variations of this term.
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html
- **Symmetric (AES-256 keys)**
  - Single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt.
  - AWS services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs.
  - You never get access to the KMS Key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use).
- **Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)**
  - Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair.
  - Used for Encrypt/Decrypt, or Sign/Verify operations.
  - The public key is downloadable, but you can't access the Private Key unencrypted.
  - Use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who can't call the KMS API.

## 2.2. Types of KMS Keys

- Types of KMS Keys:
  - AWS Owned Keys (free): SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB (default key).
  - AWS Managed Key: **free** (aws/service-name, example: aws/rds or aws/ebs).
  - Customer managed keys created in KMS.
  - Customer managed keys imported (must be symmetric key).
- **Automatic Key rotation**
  - AWS-managed KMS Key: automatic every 1 year.
  - Customer-managed KMS Key: (must be enabled) automatic every 1 year.
  - Imported KMS Key: only manual rotation possible using alias.

| Type of KMS key      | Can view KMS key metadata | Can manage KMS key | Used only for my AWS account | Automatic rotation                            | Pricing                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer managed key | Yes                       | Yes                | Yes                          | Optional. Every year (approximately 365 days) | Monthly fee (pro-rated hourly) Per-use fee                          |
| AWS managed key      | Yes                       | No                 | Yes                          | Required. Every year (approximately 365 days) | No monthly fee Per-use fee (some AWS services pay this fee for you) |
| AWS owned key        | No                        | No                 | No                           | Varies                                        | No fees                                                             |

## 2.3. Key Policies

- Control access to KMS keys, "similar" to S3 bucket policies.
- Difference: you cannot control access without them.
- **Default KMS Key Policy**
  - Created if you don't provide a specific KMS Key Policy.
  - Complete access to the key to the root user = entire AWS account.
- **Custom KMS Key Policy**
  - Define users, roles that can access the KMS key.
  - Define who can administer the key.
  - Useful for cross-account access of your KMS key.

## 2.4. Copying Snapshots across accounts

1. Create a Snapshot, encrypted with your own KMS Key (Customer Managed Key).
2. Attach a KMS Key Policy to authorize cross-account access.
3. Share the encrypted snapshot.
4. (in target) Create a copy of the Snapshot, encrypt it with a CMK in your account.
5. Create a volume from the snapshot KMS Key Policy.

## 2.5. How does KMS work? API - Encrypt and Decrypt

![Encrypt and Decrypt](/Images/AWSKMSEncryptDecrypt.png)

## 2.6. Envelope Encryption

- KMS Encrypt API call has a **limit of 4 KB**.
- If you want to encrypt >4 KB, we need to use Envelope Encryption.
- The main API that will help us is the GenerateDataKey API.
- **Anything over 4 KB of data that needs to be encrypted must use the Envelope Encryption == `GenerateDataKey` API.**

![Envelope Encryption diagram](/Images/AWSKMSEncryptDecryptEnvelope.png)

### 2.6.1. Encrypt

- It is recommended that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your application:

1. Use the GenerateDataKey operation to get a data encryption key.
2. Use the plaintext data key (returned in the Plaintext field of the response) to encrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.
3. Store the encrypted data key (returned in the CiphertextBlob field of the response) alongside the locally encrypted data.

### 2.6.2. Decrypt

- To decrypt data locally:

1. Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key. The operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key.
2. Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.

### 2.6.3. Encryption SDK

- The AWS Encryption SDK implemented Envelope Encryption for us.
- The Encryption SDK also exists as a CLI tool we can install.
- Implementations for Java, Python, C, JavaScript.
- Feature - Data Key Caching:
  - Re-use data keys instead of creating new ones for each encryption.
  - Helps with reducing the number of calls to KMS with a security trade-off.
  - Use LocalCryptoMaterialsCache (max age, max bytes, max number of messages).

### 2.6.4. Diagram

- The SDK encrypts the data encryption key and stores it (encrypted) as part of the returned ciphertext.

## 2.7. KMS Symmetric - API Summary

- `Encrypt` - Encrypt **up to 4 KB** of data through KMS.
- `GenerateDataKey`
  - Generates a unique symmetric data key (DEK).
  - Returns a plaintext copy of the data key **AND** a copy that is encrypted under the CMK that you specify.
- `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`
  - Generate a DEK to use at some point (not immediately).
  - DEK that is encrypted under the CMK that you specify (must use Decrypt later).
- `Decrypt` - Decrypt **up to 4 KB** of data (including Data Encryption Keys).
- `GenerateRandom` - Returns a random byte string.

# 3. Request Quotas

- When you exceed a request quota, you get a `ThrottlingException`:
  - **You have exceeded the rate at which you may call KMS. Reduce the frequency of your calls. (Service: AWSKMS; Status code: 400; Error Code: ThrottlingException); Request ID: <ID>**.
- To respond, use **exponential backoff** (backoff and retry).
- For cryptographic operations, they share a quota.
- This includes requests made by AWS on your behalf (ex: SSE-KMS).
- For `GenerateDataKey`, consider using DEK caching from the Encryption SDK.
- **You can request a Request Quotas increase through API or AWS support.**

# 4. S3 Bucket Key for SSE-KMS encryption

- New setting to decrease...
  - Number of API calls made to KMS from S3 by 99%.
  - Costs of overall KMS encryption with Amazon S3 by 99%.
- This leverages data keys
  - A "S3 bucket key" is generated.
  - That key is used to encrypt KMS objects with new data keys.
- You will see **less KMS CloudTrail events in CloudTrail**.

# 5. CloudHSM

- KMS => AWS manages the software for encryption.
- CloudHSM => AWS provisions encryption **hardware**.
- Dedicated Hardware (HSM = Hardware Security Module).
- You manage your own encryption keys entirely (not AWS).
- HSM device is tamper resistant, FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance.
- Supports both symmetric and **asymmetric** encryption (SSL/TLS keys).
- No free tier available.
- Must use the CloudHSM Client Software.
- Redshift supports CloudHSM for database encryption and key management.
- **Good option to use with SSE-C encryption.**

## 5.1. Diagram

- IAM permissions:
  - CRUD an HSM Cluster
- CloudHSM Software:
  - Manage the Keys

- Can assign multiple policies at a time.

# 7. AWS Secrets Manager

- Newer service, meant for storing secrets.
- Capability to force **rotation of secrets** every X days.
- Automate generation of secrets on rotation (uses Lambda).
- Integration with [Amazon RDS](/Database/Amazon%20RDS.md) (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora).
- Secrets are encrypted using KMS.
- Mostly meant for RDS integration.

![Configure Rotation](/Images/AWSSecretManagerConfigureRotation.png)

## 7.1. AWS Secrets Manager - Multi-Region Secrets

- Replicate Secrets across multiple AWS Regions.
- Secrets Manager keeps read replicas in sync with the primary Secret.
- Ability to promote a read replica Secret to a standalone Secret.
- **Use cases:** multi-region apps, disaster recovery strategies, multi-region DB...

## 7.2. Secrets Manager CloudFormation Integration RDS & Aurora

- ManageMasterUserPassword - creates admin secret implicitly.
- RDS, Aurora will manage the secret in Secrets Manager and its rotation.

## 7.3. SSM Parameter Store vs Secrets Manager

- **Secrets Manager ($$$)**
  - Automatic rotation of secrets with AWS Lambda.
  - Lambda function is provided for RDS, Redshift, DocumentDB.
  - KMS encryption is mandatory.
  - Can integration with CloudFormation.
- **SSM Parameter Store ($)**
  - Simple API.
  - No secret rotation (can enable rotation using Lambda triggered by CW Events).
  - KMS encryption is optional.
  - Can integration with CloudFormation.
  - Can pull a Secrets Manager secret using the SSM Parameter Store API.

# 8. CloudWatch Logs - Encryption

- You can encrypt CloudWatch logs with KMS keys.
- Encryption is enabled at the log group level, by associating a CMK with a log group, either when you create the log group or after it exists.
- You cannot associate a CMK with a log group using the CloudWatch console.
- You must use the CloudWatch Logs API:
  - `associate-kms-key`: if the log group already exists.
  - `create-log-group`: if the log group doesn't exist yet.

# 9. CodeBuild Security

- To access resources in your VPC, make sure you specify a VPC configuration for your CodeBuild.
- Secrets in CodeBuild:
- Don't store them as plaintext in environment variables.
- Instead...
  - Environment variables can reference parameter store parameters.
  - Environment variables can reference secrets manager secrets.

# 10. AWS Nitro Enclaves

- Process highly sensitive data in an isolated compute environment
  - Personally Identifiable Information (PII), healthcare, financial, ...
- Fully isolated virtual machines, hardened, and highly constrained
  - Not a container, not persistent storage, no interactive access, no external networking.
- Helps reduce the attack surface for sensitive data processing apps
  - Cryptographic Attestation - only authorized code can be running in your Enclave.
  - Only Enclaves can access sensitive data (integration with KMS).
- Use cases: securing private keys, processing credit cards, secure multi-party computation...
