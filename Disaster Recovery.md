# 1. Introduction

- Any event that has a negative impact on a companyâ€™s business continuity or finances is a disaster.
- Disaster recovery (DR) is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster.
- What kind of disaster recovery?
  - On-premise => On-premise: traditional DR, and very expensive.
  - On-premise => AWS Cloud: hybrid recovery.
  - AWS Cloud Region A => AWS Cloud Region B.
- Need to define two terms:
  - RPO: Recovery Point Objective.
  - RTO: Recovery Time Objective.

# 2. Disaster Recovery Strategies

- Backup and Restore.
- Pilot Light.
- Warm Standby.
- Hot Site / Multi Site Approach.
  Faster RTO

# 3. Disaster Recovery - Pilot Light

- A small version of the app is always running in the cloud.
- Useful for the critical core (pilot light).
- Very similar to Backup and Restore.
- Faster than Backup and Restore as critical systems are already up.

# 4. Warm Standby

- Full system is up and running, but at minimum size.
- Upon disaster, we can scale to production load.

# 5. Multi Site / Hot Site Approach

- Very low RTO (minutes or seconds) - very expensive.
- Full Production Scale is running AWS and On Premise.

# 6. Disaster Recovery Tips

- **Backup**
  - EBS Snapshots, RDS automated backups / Snapshots, etc...
  - Regular pushes to S3 / S3 IA / Glacier, Lifecycle Policy, Cross Region Replication.
  - From On-Premise: Snowball or Storage Gateway.
- **High Availability**
  - Use Route53 to migrate DNS over from Region to Region.
  - RDS Multi-AZ, ElastiCache Multi-AZ, EFS, S3.
  - Site to Site VPN as a recovery from Direct Connect.
- **Replication**
  - RDS Replication (Cross Region), AWS Aurora + Global Databases.
  - Database replication from on-premise to RDS.
  - Storage Gateway.
- **Automation**
  - CloudFormation / Elastic Beanstalk to re-create a whole new environment.
  - Recover / Reboot EC2 instances with CloudWatch if alarms fail.
  - AWS Lambda functions for customized automations.
- **Chaos**
  - Netflix has a "simian-army" randomly terminating EC2.
