# 1. Introduction

- **CloudFront uses Edge Location to cache content, and therefore bring more of your content closer to your viewers to improve read performance.**
- **You can use AWS WAF web access control lists (web ACLs) to help minimize the effects of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. For additional protection against DDoS attacks, AWS also provides AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced.**
- Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- **Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge.**
- Improves users experience.
- 216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations).
- DDoS protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall.

## 1.1. Origins

- **S3 bucket:**
  - For distributing files and caching them at the edge.
  - Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC).
    - OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI).
    - You want to enforce users to access the website only through CloudFront.
  - CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3).
- **Custom Origin (HTTP):**
  - Application Load Balancer.
  - EC2 instance.
  - S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website).
  - Any HTTP backend you want.

## 1.2. Restricting access to an Amazon S3 origin

- All Amazon S3 buckets in all AWS Regions, including opt-in Regions launched after December 2022.
- Amazon S3 server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)
- Dynamic requests (PUT and DELETE) to Amazon S3

# 2. CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication

- CloudFront:
  - Global Edge network.
  - Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day).
  - **Great for static content that must be available everywhere.**
- S3 Cross Region Replication:
  - Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen.
  - Files are updated in near real-time.
  - Read only.
  - **Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions.**

# 3. Caching

- The cache lives at each CloudFront **Edge Location**.
- CloudFront identifies each object in the cache using the **Cache Key** (See next section).
- You want to maximize the cache hit rate to minimize requests on the origin.
- You can invalidate part of the cache using the **CreateInvalidation** API.

## 3.1. Cache Key

- A unique identifier for every object in the cache.
- By default, consists of **hostname + resource portion of the URL**.
- If you have an application that serves up content that varies based on user, device, language, location...
- You can add other elements (HTTP headers, cookies, query strings) to the Cache Key using **CloudFront Cache Policies**.

## 3.2. Cache Policy

- Cache based on:
  - **HTTP Headers:** None - Whitelist.
  - **Cookies:** None - Whitelist - Include All-Except - All.
  - **Query Strings:** None - Whitelist - Include All-Except - All.
- Control the TTL (0 seconds to 1 year), can be set by the origin using the `Cache-Control` header, `Expires` header...
- Create your own policy or use Predefined Managed Policies.
- _All HTTP headers, cookies, and query strings that you include in the Cache Key are automatically included in origin requests._

### 3.2.1. Managing cache expiration

- **By default, each file automatically expires after 24 hours**, but you can change the default behavior in two ways:
  - To change the cache duration for all files that match the same path pattern, you can change the CloudFront settings for:
    - **Minimum TTL**
    - **Maximum TTL**
    - **Default TTL**
  - To change the cache duration for an individual file, you can configure your origin to add a `Cache-Control` header with the `max-age` or `s-maxage` directive, or an `Expires` header to the file.

### 3.2.2. HTTP Headers

- None:
  - Don't include any headers in the Cache Key (except default).
  - Headers are not forwarded (except default).
  - Best caching performance.
- Whitelist:
  - _Only specified headers_ included in the Cache Key.
  - Specified headers are also forwarded to Origin.
- Example:

  ```
  GET /blogs/myblog.html HTTP/1.1
  Host: mywebsite.com
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Mac OS X 10_15_2....)
  Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2021 17:01:57 GMT
  Authorization: SAPISIDHASH fdd00ecee39fe....
  Keep-Alive: 300
  Language: fr-fr
  ```

### 3.2.3. Cache Policy Query Strings

- **None**
  - Don't include any query strings in the Cache Key.
  - Query strings are not forwarded.
- **Whitelist**
  - Only specified query strings included in the Cache Key.
  - Only specified query strings are forwarded.
- **Include All-Except**
  - Include all query strings in the Cache Key except the specified list.
  - All query strings are forwarded except the specified list.
- **All**
  - Include all query strings in the Cache Key.
  - All query strings are forwarded.
  - Worst caching performance.
- Example: `GET /image/cat.jpg?border=red&size=large HTTP/1.1`

## 3.3. Origin Request Policy

- Specify values that you want to include in origin requests **without including them in the Cache Key (no duplicated cached content)**.
- You can include:
  - **HTTP headers:** None - Whitelist - All viewer headers options.
  - **Cookies:** None - Whitelist - All.
  - **Query Strings:** None - Whitelist - All.
- Ability to add CloudFront HTTP headers and Custom Headers to an origin request that were not included in the viewer request.
- Create your own policy or use Predefined Managed Policies.

## 3.4. Cache invalidations

- In case you update the back-end origin, CloudFront doesn't know about it and will only get the refreshed content after the TTL has expired.
- However, you can force an entire or partial cache refresh (thus bypassing the TTL) by performing a **CloudFront Invalidation**.
- You can invalidate all files (\*) or a special path (/Images/\*).

## 3.5. Cache Behaviors

- Configure different settings for a given URL path pattern.
- Example: one specific cache behavior to **Images/\*.jpg** files on your origin web server.
- Route to different kind of origins/origin groups based on the content type or path pattern:
  - /Images/\*
  - /api/\*
  - /\* (default cache behavior)
- When adding additional Cache Behaviors, the Default Cache Behavior is always the last to be processed **and is always /\***

# 4. Geo Restriction

- You can restrict who can access your distribution:
  - **Whitelist:** Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the countries on a list of approved countries.
  - **Blacklist:** Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the countries on a blacklist of banned countries.
- The "country" is determined using a 3rd party Geo-IP database.
- Use case: Copyright Laws to control access to content.

# 5. Signed URL / Signed Cookies

- You want to distribute paid shared content to premium users over the world.
- To **Restrict Viewer Access**, we can create a CloudFront Signed URL / Cookie.
- How long should the URL be valid for?
  - Shared content (movie, music): Make it short (a few minutes).
  - Private content (private to the user): You can make it last for years.
- Signed URL = access to individual files (one signed URL per file).
- Signed Cookies = access to multiple files (one signed cookie for many files).

## 5.1. Signed URL vs S3 Pre-Signed URL

### 5.1.1. CloudFront Signed URL

- Allow access to a path, no matter the origin.
- **Account wide key-pair, only the root can manage it.**
- Can filter by IP, path, date, expiration.
- Can leverage caching features.

### 5.1.2. S3 Pre-Signed URL

- Issue a request as the person who pre-signed the URL.
- Uses the IAM key of the signing IAM principal.
- Limited lifetime.

## 5.2. Signed URL Process

- Two types of signers:
  - Either a trusted key group (recommended):
    - Can leverage APIs to create and rotate keys (and IAM for API security).
  - An AWS Account that contains a CloudFront Key Pair:
    - Need to manage keys using **the root account and the AWS console**.
    - Not recommended because you shouldn't use the root account for this.
- In your CloudFront distribution, create one or more trusted key groups.
- You generate your own public / private key:
  - The private key is used by your applications (e.g. EC2) to sign URLs.
  - The public key (uploaded) is used by CloudFront to verify URLs.

# 6. Pricing

- CloudFront Edge locations are all around the world.
- The cost of data out per edge location varies.

[CloudFront Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/)

## 6.1. Price Classes

- You can reduce the number of edge locations for cost reduction.
- Three price classes:

1. Price Class All: all regions - best performance.
2. Price Class 200: most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions.
3. Price Class 100: only the least expensive regions.

# 7. Multiple Origin

- To route to different kind of origins based on the content type
- Based on path pattern:
  - /Images/\*
  - /api/\*
  - /\*

## 7.1. Origin Groups

- To increase high-availability and do failover.
- Origin Group: one primary and one secondary origin.
- If the primary origin fails, the second one is used.

![CloudFront Origin Groups](Images/AWSCloudFrontOriginGroups.png)

# 8. Field Level Encryption

- Protect user sensitive information through application stack.
- Adds an additional layer of security along with HTTPS.
- Sensitive information encrypted at the edge close to user.
- Uses asymmetric encryption.
- Usage:
  - Specify set of fields in POST requests that you want to be encrypted (up to 10 fields).
  - Specify the public key to encrypt them.

# 9. Real Time Logs

- Get real-time requests received by CloudFront sent to Kinesis Data Streams.
- Monitor, analyze, and take actions based on content delivery performance.
- Allows you to choose:
  - Sampling Rate - percentage of requests for which you want to receive.
  - Specific fields and specific Cache Behaviors (path patterns).

# 10. HTTPS for communication between viewers and CloudFront

- Change the **Origin Protocol Policy** and **Viewer Protocol Policy**.
